            <p>
              Iâ€™m a QA Engineer, graduated from King Abdulaziz University. Iâ€™ve
              built my path with a strong focus on quality, detail, and user
              experience. Beyond testing, I enjoy designing clean and creative
              interfaces, and I love bringing ideas to life by building apps and
              websites that people enjoy using.
            </p>

            <p className="about-note">
              When Iâ€™m not testing or designing, Iâ€™m probably exploring new ideas
              for apps or learning something creative âœ¨
